# Instructions

## Problem 2

Use sentence.js for this one.

The makeSentence(description, array) takes two parameters: a description and an array.

You should return a string that is a combination of the description and the array.

> Example 1: if you pass in "largest planets”, and the array [”Jupiter, “Neptune”, “Uranus”], you should return the string: "The 3 largest planets are Jupiter, Neptune, Uranus”

> Example 2: If you pass in "best chess players” and [”Magnus”, “Bobby”, “Judit”, “Hou”], it should return: "The 4 best chess players are Magnus, Bobby, Judit, Hou”

You’ll need to use a for-loop and template strings for this problem.
